# ROS-P3DX
Instructions for internal use of Mobile Robot P3-DX with Robotic Operating System.

such as RosAria, sicktoolbox, gmapping and map_server.

Due to technical issues and the programs not working properly I shut down my study
about it. One of the last problems was caused by a difference on the clocks.
